# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI agents working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This repository contains the TypeScript SDK workspace for Suigar v2 on Sui. The current publishable packages are `@suigar/sdk` under `packages/sdk` and `@suigar/mcp` under `packages/mcp`. Both packages are ESM-only. The main public SDK integration surface is the `suigar()` client extension, which is used to build and serialize game transactions on top of `@mysten/sui`.

## Common Commands

### Build System

- Uses pnpm workspaces from the private `@suigar/ts-sdks` root package and `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
- Uses `tsdown` to emit ESM-only outputs into `packages/sdk/dist/`
- Uses `tsdown` for package outputs and Vite single-file builds for the MCP App under `packages/mcp/dist/`
- Uses `sui-ts-codegen generate` to regenerate `packages/sdk/src/contracts/`
- Generated contract bindings are runtime-critical and should stay aligned with the current Suigar packages

### Key Patterns

1. **Client extension first**: Prefer integrating through `suigar()` on an existing client such as `SuiGrpcClient` or any other `ClientWithCoreApi` implementation instead of bypassing the extension layer.
2. **Public package exports**: The package exposes `@suigar/sdk`, `@suigar/sdk/games`, and `@suigar/sdk/utils`. The package root exports `suigar`, `SuigarClient`, `SUPPORTED_SUI_NETWORKS`, `SuigarNetwork`, and `SuigarCoin`. Game-related public types and constants such as `GAMES`, `Game`, `StandardGame`, `PvPGame`, `CoinSide`, and `PvPCoinflipAction` should prefer `@suigar/sdk/games`, and parser or helper utilities should prefer `@suigar/sdk/utils`. Reusable SDK constants such as `DEFAULT_GAS_BUDGET_MIST`, `DEFAULT_QUERY_LIMIT`, `RANGE_POINT_LIMIT`, `DEFAULT_RANGE_SCALE`, and `DEFAULT_LIMBO_MULTIPLIER_SCALE` are part of the intended `@suigar/sdk/utils` integration surface and should not be redefined in app code when the SDK export is suitable. `DEFAULT_QUERY_LIMIT` is `50`, the reusable default page size for SDK queries; `getPvPCoinflipGames()` currently uses it when called without options. Utility function behavior:
   - `toBigInt()` accepts `bigint`, finite `number`, non-negative integer `string`, and `boolean` values. It throws `TypeError` for invalid input shapes and `RangeError` for negatives.
   - `toU8()` accepts a finite integer `number` or plain integer `string` in the `0..255` range. It throws `TypeError` for non-numeric input and `RangeError` for non-integer or out-of-range values.
   - `toU16()` accepts a finite integer `number` or plain integer `string` in the `0..65535` range. It uses the same `TypeError` and `RangeError` split as `toU8()`.
   - `parseCoinType()` throws `TypeError` when the first generic coin type cannot be parsed from the Move type string.
3. **Transaction builders by game family**: Standard games use `createGameBet`; PvP games use dedicated game properties such as `pvpCoinflip`, each with its own action builders. Unsupported game ids and unsupported configured coin types surface as `RangeError`s.
4. **Generated contract wrappers**: `packages/sdk/src/transactions/` adapts app-facing options into generated Move calls from `packages/sdk/src/contracts/`.
5. **Type safety**: All game flows are strongly typed through `CreateGameBetOptions`, action-specific PvP options, and normalized config helpers.
6. **MCP uses public SDK APIs**: `@suigar/mcp` should build transactions through `client.suigar.tx`, inspect config through `client.suigar.getConfig()`, and avoid imports from private Suigar workspace packages.

### Suigar Client Architecture

The SDK is organized around a client extension plus typed transaction builders. Understanding that separation is important before changing behavior.

#### Layered Design

The integration has three practical layers:

1. **Public SDK surface** - `suigar()` and `SuigarClient` exposed from the package root, with additional public subpaths for `games` and `utils`.
2. **Client extension implementation** - `packages/sdk/src/client.ts` registers the extension on top of a `ClientWithCoreApi` and exposes serialization, BCS helpers, and transaction builders.
3. **Transaction and contract layer** - `packages/sdk/src/transactions/` consumes network-resolved config, normalizes user input, and invokes generated Move wrappers from `packages/sdk/src/contracts/`.

Key files:

| Layer                       | File                                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Public entrypoint           | `packages/sdk/src/index.ts`          |
| Extension and client API    | `packages/sdk/src/client.ts`         |
| Standard game builders      | `packages/sdk/src/transactions/*.ts` |
| Generated contracts and BCS | `packages/sdk/src/contracts/**`      |
| Public utility exports      | `packages/sdk/src/utils/*.ts`        |
| Internal helper modules     | `packages/sdk/src/helpers/*.ts`      |

#### Standard vs PvP Flows

There are two transaction families and they must not be mixed:

- **Standard games** use `client.suigar.tx.createGameBet(gameId, options)` for `coinflip`, `limbo`, `plinko`, `range`, `soccer`, and `wheel`.
- **PvP games** use dedicated per-game transaction properties, such as `client.suigar.tx.pvpCoinflip`, and should keep PvP game rules separate from standard game flows.
- **PvP coinflip unresolved lobby lookups** use `client.suigar.getPvPCoinflipGames(options?)`:
  - Calling it without options uses `DEFAULT_QUERY_LIMIT` (`50`); supply `limit: DEFAULT_QUERY_LIMIT` when also passing `cursor` or another query option.
  - Bulk-load lobby objects with `client.core.getObjects()`.
  - Skip per-object fetch or parse failures by default.
  - Reject on per-object fetch or parse failures only when `throwOnError: true` is passed.
  - Return each parsed game with a derived `coin_type` string from the Move object type.
- **Specific PvP coinflip game object lookups** should use the exported generated helper, `client.suigar.bcs.PvPCoinflipGame.get({ client, objectId })`, when a product needs one live game object outside the registry list.

When making changes:

- Read both the client entrypoint and the relevant transaction builder before changing behavior.
- Keep standard and PvP option shapes separate.
- Do not route PvP coinflip through the standard game builder.

#### Config Resolution

Config is normalized in `packages/sdk/src/helpers/config.ts`. This layer is responsible for:

- Resolving network-scoped package ids
- Normalizing the configured supported coin types for the active network
- Resolving price info object ids from the supported-coin mapping
- Throwing explicit errors when a required coin mapping is missing
- Providing the price info object id used by PvP coinflip join

Treat unsupported network resolution and unsupported configured coin types as `RangeError` cases when documenting or testing these flows.

#### Game Parameters

`client.suigar.getGameParameters(game, { coinType, ...options })` requires a coin type. It reads the selected game's settings object from SweetHouse, then that coin's `Parameters<T>` object. It parses the result, decodes Move float fields into JavaScript numbers—including nested Plinko and Wheel multipliers—and caches it for `cacheTtl`.

This is a core invariant: standard game transactions must fail clearly when the required price info object configuration is not available for the chosen coin type.

#### Referral

- Use `packageIds.referral` with `client.suigar.tx.referral` for claims.
- Use `client.suigar.view.referral` for simulated claimable amounts.

#### NFT V1

- Use `packageIds.nftV1` and `objectIds.nftV1Factory` for lookups.
- Use `client.suigar.tx.nftV1.mint({ owner, specId })` to mint.
- Read the selected specification's SUI price from the configured factory when the transaction is built.

#### Metadata and Amount Handling

- Treat `stake` as the logical wager used in the Move call.
- Use `cashStake` only when the withdrawn balance should differ from the logical stake.
- Prefer `bigint` for all non-UI amount handling.
- Pass plain application values to `metadata` and let the SDK encode them into byte arrays.
- Treat the extension-level `partner` option as a partner wallet address, not a label or slug.
- When partner attribution is required, configure `suigar({ partner: '<wallet-address>' })` once during extension setup instead of passing partner data through transaction metadata.
- Prefer importing public constants and numeric helpers from `@suigar/sdk/utils` instead of duplicating SDK defaults in downstream apps.

### MCP Package Architecture

`packages/mcp` exposes a local stdio MCP server plus a bundled MCP App resource. It should stay thin over `@suigar/sdk` and `@mysten/sui`.

- Register tools with modern MCP SDK APIs such as `McpServer.registerTool` and `registerAppTool`.
- Always return both text `content` and `structuredContent`.
- Keep tool errors actionable and include the field/config/network detail needed for an agent to retry.
- Keep SDK-style MCP config documentation aligned with `SuigarConfigOverrides`: both `coins.sui` and `coins.usdc` accept optional `coinType`, `decimals`, and `priceInfoObjectId` metadata.
- The MCP App is an inspector UI only. It must not sign or execute transactions, and it should include restrictive `_meta.ui.csp` metadata.
- Do not reintroduce explicit coin object sourcing or copied transaction builders unless the SDK adds a public API for that behavior.
- If a new MCP behavior requires an SDK change, add the SDK change, tests, docs, and an `@suigar/sdk` changeset entry in the same task.

### Testing Conventions

- `packages/sdk/test/unit/transactions.test.ts` covers transaction composition, normalization, and generated wrapper integration.
- `packages/sdk/test/unit/config.test.ts` covers config resolution and defaults.
- When changing transaction behavior, update tests to cover package id resolution, owner-address normalization, and action-specific argument mapping.

### Changeset Conventions

- **`patch`**: Bug fixes or internal corrections that do not change the public API shape
- **`minor`**: New public methods, new supported fields, or additive public type changes
- **`major`**: Breaking API changes, changed behavior contracts, or removed support
- Changeset notes must describe only package behavior for the packages listed in the changeset frontmatter. Do not mention root-only, workspace-only, playground-only, or tooling-only changes unless they directly affect that package's published behavior.
- Do not edit changeset files inherited from `main` or previous work. When a branch needs a release note, update the changeset already committed on the current branch; create one only if the branch has none.

### Development Workflow

1. Update or add code in the relevant package under `packages/*/src/`
2. If the branch modifies source files under any publishable package, update the `.changeset/*.md` file already committed on that branch; create one only when no branch changeset exists
3. Reuse that committed branch changeset for later publishable-package source edits instead of creating a new changeset, unless the user explicitly wants multiple distinct release notes
4. When SDK contract bindings or generated SDK sources change, regenerate them with `pnpm --dir packages/sdk run codegen`; otherwise run any generation required by each changed package
5. Run tests for every changed package, for example `pnpm --dir packages/sdk run test` or `pnpm --dir packages/mcp run test`
6. Run type checking for every changed package, for example `pnpm --dir packages/sdk run typecheck` or `pnpm --dir packages/mcp run typecheck`
7. Add or update the current branch changeset when user-visible package behavior changes, keeping each note scoped to the package or packages listed in its frontmatter

Documentation is part of the deliverable:

- When publishable-package behavior, public types, generated bindings, examples, or integration guidance change, update the relevant documentation in the same task without waiting for an extra prompt.
- At minimum, review root `README.md`, the changed package's README where present, `AGENTS.md`, the relevant Suigar skills in `Suigar-Gaming/agent-skills`, and any other user-facing markdown that describes the changed behavior.
- Treat skill updates as automatic follow-up work when their guidance overlaps the changed SDK behavior; do not wait for the user to ask explicitly.
- If constants, helper locations, or public utility exports move, update docs and examples to use the public import path instead of internal file paths or copied values.
- If generated bindings or public runtime ergonomics change, make sure examples and event-decoding guidance stay aligned with the current generated API.
- If installation or client setup guidance changes, keep examples aligned with the current APIs such as `@mysten/sui/grpc`, explicit `network`, and ESM-only package requirements.

## AI Skills

Suigar agent skills live in the separate `Suigar-Gaming/agent-skills` repository.

Install the skills for an agent with the skills CLI:

```bash
npx skills add Suigar-Gaming/agent-skills
```

Install a single skill when only one workflow is needed:

```bash
npx skills add Suigar-Gaming/agent-skills --skill suigar-mcp
```

For Codex-specific installs, add the Codex agent flag without replacing the generic install commands above:

```bash
npx skills add Suigar-Gaming/agent-skills --agent codex --global --yes
```

```bash
npx skills add Suigar-Gaming/agent-skills --skill suigar-mcp --agent codex --global --yes
```

Use these Suigar skills when the task is about building a product on top of this SDK:

- `installation` for SDK setup, client extension wiring, and config
- `suigar-mcp` for installing, configuring, and operating the `@suigar/mcp` server and MCP App
- `create-standard-games` for standard game transactions
- `create-pvp-games` for PvP game flows
- `find-skills` to discover installable external skills when users ask for capabilities or workflows that may already exist

Claude Code compatibility:

- `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to `AGENTS.md`

## Pull Requests

When creating a PR:

- Summarize the SDK or transaction behavior change clearly
- If the branch modifies source files under any publishable package, make sure the branch includes a `.changeset/*.md` file; update the changeset already committed on the branch, creating one only if none exists, unless multiple release notes are intentionally needed
- PRs that change publishable-package source files without a changeset are expected to fail merge checks and receive a PR comment
- Mention whether generated bindings changed
- Include tests run
- If the PR was primarily written by AI, mark that in the PR description
