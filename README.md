# Suigar TypeScript SDKs

A collection of TypeScript SDKs and MCP tooling for interacting with the Suigar contracts.

## Documentation

For SDK documentation, visit [suigar.com/docs/sdk](https://suigar.com/docs/sdk).

For MCP documentation, visit [suigar.com/docs/mcp](https://suigar.com/docs/mcp).

For Sui TypeScript SDK documentation, visit [sdk.mystenlabs.com](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/).

## Install the MCP server

Install Suigar MCP for all detected coding agents with [add-mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/add-mcp):

```bash
npx add-mcp @suigar/mcp@latest --name suigar
```

Add `-y` to skip the installer prompts. Restart or reload your MCP client after installation.

To configure an MCP client manually, use:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"suigar": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "@suigar/mcp@latest"]
		}
	}
}
```

## Agent Skills

Suigar agent skills live in the separate `Suigar-Gaming/agent-skills` repository. The MCP-focused skill teaches agents how to install, configure, and operate `@suigar/mcp` for Suigar config reads, game metadata, NFT lookups, referral claim reads, SweetHouse transaction builders, unsigned transaction builders, and dry-runs.

Install all Suigar skills with:

```bash
npx skills add Suigar-Gaming/agent-skills --global --yes
```

Install only the MCP skill with:

```bash
npx skills add Suigar-Gaming/agent-skills --skill suigar-mcp --global --yes
```

## Packages

- `@suigar/sdk` in `packages/sdk`: ESM-only TypeScript SDK for Suigar provably fair on-chain Sui casino game, SweetHouse, NFT, and referral transactions.
- `@suigar/mcp` in `packages/mcp`: MCP stdio server and MCP App for reading Suigar config, game metadata, NFTs, and referral claim amounts, plus building unsigned Suigar and SweetHouse transactions through the SDK.

Public packages are published to both [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40suigar) and [JSR](https://jsr.io/@suigar).

## Development

Any of the following commands can be run at the root of the project.

When running a task that depends on generated or built artifacts, use `turbo` to ensure task dependencies are run first.

### Setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```

Dependency install scripts are disabled by default in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. If a new dependency needs an install or build script, explicitly review it before approving it with `pnpm approve-builds`. Transitive dependencies are also blocked from resolving untrusted git or tarball URLs.

### Building

```bash
pnpm run build
# or
pnpm turbo run build
```

### Unit Tests

For unit tests:

```bash
pnpm run test
# or
pnpm turbo run test
```

### Type Checking

```bash
pnpm run typecheck
# or
pnpm turbo run typecheck
```

### Linting

This repo uses Oxlint and Oxfmt for linting and formatting.

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

You can automatically fix many lint issues by running:

```bash
pnpm run lint:fix
```

To run Oxlint and Oxfmt individually, use:

```bash
pnpm run oxlint
pnpm run oxfmt
pnpm run oxlint:fix
pnpm run oxfmt:fix
```
