# Suigar TypeScript SDKs

A collection of TypeScript SDKs for interacting with the Suigar contracts.

## Documentation

For SDK documentation, visit [docs.suigar.com/sdk](https://docs.suigar.com/sdk).

## Development

Any of the following commands can be run at the root of the project.

When running a task that depends on generated or built artifacts, use `turbo` to
ensure task dependencies are run first.

### Setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

Dependency install scripts are disabled by default in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. If
a new dependency needs an install or build script, explicitly review it before
approving it with `pnpm approve-builds`. Transitive dependencies are also
blocked from resolving untrusted git or tarball URLs.

### Building

```bash
pnpm build
# or
pnpm turbo build
```

### Unit Tests

For unit tests:

```bash
pnpm test
# or
pnpm turbo test
```

### Type Checking

```bash
pnpm typecheck
# or
pnpm turbo typecheck
```

### Linting

This repo uses ESLint and Prettier for linting.

```bash
pnpm lint
```

You can automatically fix many lint issues by running:

```bash
pnpm lint:fix
```

To run ESLint and Prettier individually, use:

```bash
pnpm eslint
pnpm prettier
pnpm eslint:fix
pnpm prettier:fix
```
